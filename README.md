# My personal site

> My new personal site made in Boostrap, with a focus on clean simplicity.

## Reason for making a new personal site:
I was 3 months in to coding when I started making my personal site, I was very ambitous and wanted a ton of 
functionality and basically wanted it to be both complex and simple. The site ended up with a lot of cool functionality that wasn't implemented well, and made it even more complex to have it be mobile friendly.

## What I learned:
* I learned that simplicity is deceptively complex.
* I learned not every website needs to break the idea of a clean website.
* I learned simplicity is beautiful, and hard.
